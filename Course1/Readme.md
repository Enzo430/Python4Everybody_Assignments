From the instructor: In this course we will cover the basic building blocks of programming and write a few simple programs. We are committed to making sure that you are successful in this course even if you have no previous programming experience. This course covers Chapters 1-5 of my free textbook 'Python for Everybody: Exploring Data in Python 3' (available at www.py4e.com).

This is the first of a series courses in the Python for Everybody specialization. We hope that you are successful in this course and continue with the rest of the courses in the specialization.

Again welcome to the course and best of luck in the class.
