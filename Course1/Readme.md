From the instructor: 
In this course we will cover the basic building blocks of programming and write a few simple programs. We are committed to making sure that you are successful in this course even if you have no previous programming experience. This course covers Chapters 1-5 of my free textbook 'Python for Everybody: Exploring Data in Python 3' (available at www.py4e.com).

This is the first of a series courses in the Python for Everybody specialization. We hope that you are successful in this course and continue with the rest of the courses in the specialization.

Again welcome to the course and best of luck in the class.

- Chuck and the Teaching Staff of Python for Everybody

Chapter 1: Why We Program: In the first chapter we try to cover the "big picture" of programming so you get a "table of contents" of the rest of the book. Don't worry if not everything makes perfect sense the first time you hear it. This chapter is quite broad and you would benefit from reading the chapter in the book in addition to watching the lectures to help it all sink in. You might want to come back and re-watch these lectures after you have funished a few more chapters.\

Chapter 2: Variables and Expressions: In this chapter we cover how a program uses the computer's memory to store, retrieve and calculate information.

Chapter 3: Conditional Code: In this section we move from sequential code that simply runs one line of code after another to conditional code where some steps are skipped. It is a very simple concept - but it is how computer software makes "choices".

Chapter 4: Functions: This is a relatively short chapter. We will learn about what functions are and how we can use them. The programs in the first chapters of the book are not large enough to require us to develop functions, but as the book moves into more and more complex programs, functions will be an essential way for us to make sense of our code.

Chapter 5: Loops and Iteration: Loops and iteration complete our four basic programming patterns. Loops are the way we tell Python to do something over and over. Loops are the way we build programs that stay with a problem until the problem is solved.
