In this class, we pick up where we left off in the previous class, starting in 
Chapter 6 of the textbook and covering Strings and moving into data structures. 

Chapter 6: Strings

Chapter 7: Files: Up to now, we have been working with data that is read from the user or data in constants. But real programs process much larger amounts of data by reading and writing files on the secondary storage on your computer. In this chapter we start to write our first programs that read, scan, and process real data. 

Chapter 8: Lists: As we want to solve more complex problems in Python, we need more powerful variables. Up to now we have been using simple variables to store numbers or strings where we have a single value in a variable. Starting with lists we will store many values in a single variable using an indexing scheme to store, organize, and retrieve different values from within a single variable. We call these multi-valued variables "collections" or "data structures".

Chapter 9: Dictionaries: The Python dictionary is one of its most powerful data structures. Instead of representing values in a linear list, dictionaries store data as key / value pairs. Using key / value pairs gives us a simple in-memory "database" in a single Python variable.

Chapter 10: Tuples: Tuples are our third and final basic Python data structure. Tuples are a simple version of lists. We often use tuples in conjunction with dictionaries to accomplish multi-step tasks like sorting or looping through all of the data in a dictionary.

From instructor:

Congratulations on finishing Python Data Structures. I really want to thank you for sharing your time with us.

Completing the first two courses in the Python Specialization (Getting Started with Python and this course) is an important milestone in your programming education. You are half way through the specialization and at the point where you switch from learning how to program to how to use your programming skills.

To celebrate this important moment and transition, we have a nice graduation recorded ceremony that you can view - complete with a commencement speech from Indiana University professor Curt Bonk.

I would not wait too long before starting the next course in the sequence to avoid forgetting what you know and then needing to come back and review.

Again, thank you for sharing your time with us in this course.
