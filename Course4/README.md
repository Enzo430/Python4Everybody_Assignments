Chapter 14: Object Oriented Python: 

To start this class out we cover the basics of Object Oriented Python. We won't be writing our own objects, but since many of the things we use like BeautifulSoup, strings, dictionaries, database connections all use Object Oriented (OO) patterns we should at least understand some of its patterns and terminology.

Chapter 15: OBasic Structured Query Language: 

We learn the four core CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) to manage data stored in a database.

Chapter 15: Data Models and Relational SQL: 

In this section we learn about how data is stored across multiple tables in a database and how rows are linked (i.e., we establish relationships) in the database.

Chapter 15: Many-to-Many Relationships in SQL: 

In this section we explore how to model situations like students enrolling in courses where each course has many students and each student is enrolled in many courses.

Chapter 16: Databases and Visualization: 

In this section, we put it all together, retrieve and process some data and then use the Google Maps API to visualize our data.

From Instructor:

Congratulations on finishing Using Databases with Python. I really want to thank you for sharing your time with us.

Completing all four courses within the Python for Everybody Specialization is an important milestone in your programming education. I would now like to encourage you to join us in the Capstone: Retrieving, Processing, and Visualizing Data with Python. The projects within the Capstone will involve all of the elements that you have learned throughout the four courses, and is an opportunity to demonstrate everything that you have learned.

Again, thank you for sharing your time with us in this course.

- Chuck and the Teaching Staff of Python for Everybody
