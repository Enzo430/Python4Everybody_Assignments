Week 1: Welcome to the Capstone

Week 2: Building a Search Engine: 

This week we will download and run a simple version of the Google PageRank Algorithm and practice spidering some content. The assignment is peer-graded, and the first of three required assignments in the course. This a continuation of the material covered in Course 4 of the specialization, and is based on Chapter 16 of the textbook. 

Week 3: Exploring Data Sources (Project):

The optional Capstone project is your opportunity to select, process, and visualize the data of your choice, and receive feedback from your peers. The project is not graded, and can be as simple or complex as you like. This week's assignment is to identify a data source and make a short discussion forum post describing the data source and outlining some possible analysis that could be done with it. You will not be required to use the data source presented here for your actual analysis.

Week 4: Spidering and Modeling Email Data:

In our second required assignment, we will retrieve and process email data from the Sakai open source project. Video lectures will walk you through the process of retrieving, cleaning up, and modeling the data.

Week 5: Accessing New Data Sources (Project):

The task for this week is to make a discussion thread post that reflects the progress you have made to date in retrieving and cleaning up your data source so can perform your analysis. Feedback from other students is encouraged to help you refine the process.

Week 6: Visualizing Email Data:

In the final required assignment, we will do two visualizations of the email data you have retrieved and processed: a word cloud to visualize the frequency distribution and a timeline to show how the data is changing over time.

Week 7: Visualizing new Data Sources (Project):

This week you will discuss the analysis of your data to the class. While many of the projects will result in a visualization of the data, any other results of analyzing the data are equally valued, so use whatever form of analysis and display is most appropriate to the data set you have selected.




Welcome to the Python for Everybody Capstone! Here you will build a series of applications to retrieve, process, and visualize data using elements you have learned from each course within the specialization. You will create visualizations to become familiar with the technologies, and will have optional assignments for exploring course concepts in even more detail and sharing your results with other students. Chapter 16 from the book “Python for Everybody: Exploring Data in Python 3” (available at www.py4e.com) will serve as the backbone for the capstone.

Congratulations for making it this far!
